abstract: This paper investigates the Parisian ruin probability for processes with power-asymmetric behavior of the variance near the unique optimal point. We derive the exact asymptotics as the ruin boundary tends to infinity and extend the previous result arXiv:1504.07061 to the case when the length of Parisian interval is of Pickands scale. As a primary application, we extend the recent result arXiv:2010.00222 on the many inputs proportional reinsurance fractional Brownian motion risk model to the Parisian ruin.
