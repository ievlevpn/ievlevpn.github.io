## Overview

We study high exceedance probabilities $\mathbb{P}\\{\exists t \in [0, T]: X(t) > ub\\}$ as $u \to \infty$ for centered $\mathbb{R}^d$-valued Gaussian random fields. The main contribution is extending the double-sum method to non-homogeneous vector-valued Gaussian fields that are "locally additive" near high exceedance points.

## Main Results

- **Theorem 1:** Exact asymptotic equivalence for exceedance probabilities involving Pickands-type and geometric constants
- **Double Crossing Probability:** Asymptotics for $\mathbb{P}\\{\exists t, s: X(t) > au, X(s) < -bu\\}$

## Applications

- **Stationary Processes:** Different regimes depending on smoothness parameter $\alpha$ (Pickands-type for $\alpha < 1$, Piterbarg-type for $\alpha = 1$)
- **Fractional Brownian Motion:** Results for all Hurst indices $H \in (0,1)$ with regime changes at $H = 1/2$
