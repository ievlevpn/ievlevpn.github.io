abstract: Following the works of I. A. Ibrahimov, N. V. Smorodina and M. M. Faddeev, we develop a new construction of the Brownian motion with reflection in $d$-ball. The main advantage of our new approach is that it allows one to construct reflecting LÃ©vy processes, whereas previous constructions are limited to diffusion processes. In our upcoming work we shall extend the results to the symmetric Levy processes in a smooth domain.
