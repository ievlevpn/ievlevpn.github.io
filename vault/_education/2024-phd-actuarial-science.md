**Title:** Towards a Theory of Multivariate Gaussian Extremes

**Abstract:** This thesis explores several directions in the theory of extremal behaviour of Gaussian processes opened by a recent paper by K. D ̧ebicki, E. Hashorva and L. Wang (2019). In Chapter 2 we extend their results from processes to a simple yet rich class of non-homogenous vector-valued Gaussian random fields. As an application of this extension, we derive exact asymptotic approximations of the so-called double crossing probabilities. In Chapters 3, we present a new class of covariance matrix functions of exponential type, which we later apply in Chapter 4 in conjunction with the Gordon inequality to the study of extremes of locally-homogenous Gaussian random fields. This allows to significantly simplify proofs and avoid using stringent assumptions, required by the previously available techniques. In Chapter 5, we introduce a class of multivariate Gaussian processes, Brownian decision trees, closely related to the well-known Branching Brownian motion and study their extremal behaviour. In Chapter 6, we investigate the Parisian ruin in the so-called many inputs proportional reinsurance risk model with fractional Brownian motion input.
