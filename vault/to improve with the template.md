- still no control over some pages from within obsidian, such as talk's standalone page
- files should by default be within `vault` folder, not in `/assets`
- obsidian links don't work so far
- latex doesn't fully work. e.g., `$$` doesn't produce displayed equations
- dark theme switch should be easy to implement
- and also fontsize switch maybe
- `... | limit 5` doesn't work, change everywhere to `... | slice 0, 5`
