## Course Outline

### I. Linear Programming
- **Forms:** Canonical, standard; transformations between forms
- **Tableaus:** Bases, basic solutions, feasibility, pivoting
- **Simplex Algorithm:** Phase I (feasibility), Phase II (optimization), degeneracy, Bland's rule
- **Duality:** Weak/strong duality, complementary slackness, dual simplex

### II. Graph Theory & Networks
- **Fundamentals:** Directed/undirected graphs, connectivity, adjacency/incidence matrices
- **Shortest Path:** Bellman's principle, Dijkstra's algorithm
- **Transshipment Problem:** Network simplex, spanning tree solutions, pricing, ratio test

### III. Combinatorial Optimization
- **Branch and Bound:** Enumeration trees, relaxation, branching, bounding, pruning
- **Dynamic Programming:** Bellman's principle, backward induction, applications (knapsack, inventory, shortest path with negative weights)

### IV. Non-Linear Optimization
- **Unconstrained:** Local/global optima, first/second order conditions, convexity, Hessian analysis
- **Constrained:** Lagrange multipliers, KKT conditions, Slater's condition, Lagrangian duality

### V. Iterative Algorithms
- **Descent Methods:** Steepest descent, Wolfe conditions, backtracking linesearch
